For assignment 9 I built a README Generator that allows users to generate a quality README file. I used the Inquirer package for this assignment because it provided an easy way to capture user input in the Node.js command line. 

CHALLENGES: The challenges I faced with this assignment were obtaining the badges for the licenses and ensuring the top of the README was the title of the user's project. The last prompt on my application applies the users input as the README title, which is something I'm going to repair.

This is a screenshot of my index.js script with the directory open in the Terminal. It shows the prompts that I created inside a function using the Inquirer package.
